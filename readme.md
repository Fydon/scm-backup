# SCM Backup

A backup tool which clones all your repositories to your local machine.

It's similar to [Bitbucket Backup](http://christianspecht.de/bitbucket-backup/), but it will support multiple source code hosters *(starting with GitHub)* and multiple users/teams.  
And it's written in [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/), which means that it's supposed to run on Windows, Linux **and** MacOS.


## Documentation

...doesn't exist yet because right now, SCM Backup is still a work in progress.  
Proper documentation will follow later, as soon as SCM Backup is in a usable state.
