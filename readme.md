[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/a28uyjw91iim9wv9?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ChristianSpecht/scm-backup)

A backup tool which clones all your repositories to your local machine.

It's similar to [Bitbucket Backup](http://christianspecht.de/bitbucket-backup/), but it will support multiple source code hosters *(starting with GitHub)* and multiple users/teams.  
And it's written in [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/), which means that it's supposed to run on Windows, Linux **and** MacOS.
